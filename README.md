## Starting Information
This is a MERN stack web game where you are Purrlock Holmes attempting to solve multiple ciphers and mysteries. The game is designed to be educational and fun, with a focus on teaching the player about cryptography and ciphers. The game is designed to be played in a web browser, and is designed to be played on a desktop or laptop computer with a large fixed aspect ratio, ideally 1920 x 1080.

The live deployment of this game can be found at: https://project-group-lively-lions.onrender.com/

Have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/UOA-CS732-SE750-Students-2024/project-group-lively-lions/wiki) for a detailed breakdown of our project development, the ciphers used in this game, the backend and database used, the game visual and audio assets, our meeting notes from the past few months, and our contribution breakdown.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have the latest version of git, pnpm (>=8.15.1), node (>=20.11.0) installed.
2. Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/UOA-CS732-SE750-Students-2024/project-group-lively-lions.git`) into your preferred folder
3. `cd project-group-lively-lions` then run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm run dev` to start a local development server on your machine.
5. Open your browser and navigate to local host to see the game in action.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/UOA-CS732-SE750-Students-2024/project-group-lively-lions.git
cd project-group-lively-lions

#run the following if using pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm run dev

#run the following if using npm
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Other commands

- Alt + Shift + F should format the code in the current file according to Prettier + ESLint rules, otherwise you can also run `pnpm run format` to format all files.
- Running `pnpm run build` produces an application bundle that is suitable to be served over a static hosting service in `./dist`. Subsequently, running `pnpm run preview` will boot up a local server with the application bundle in `./dist`.

### Used packages

We used VS Code with a variety of packages to make the development process easier and faster. The main packages used by the team were:

- Prettier - Code formatter
- ESLint
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Github Copilot.
  (Optional) Change the corresponding VSCode settings:
