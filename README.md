## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have the latest version of pnpm (8.15.1) and node (20.11.0) installed.
2. Install the Prettier and EsLint plugins on VSCode.
3. Clone the repository, then run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm run dev` to start a local development server on your machine.

### Other commands

- Alt + Shift + F should format the code in the current file according to Prettier + ESLint rules, otherwise you can also run `pnpm run format` to format all files.
- Running `pnpm run build` produces an application bundle that is suitable to be served over a static hosting service in `./dist`. Subsequently, running `pnpm run preview` will boot up a local server with the application bundle in `./dist`.
