## Features

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have the latest version of git, pnpm (>=8.15.1), node (>=20.11.0) installed.
2. Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/UOA-CS732-SE750-Students-2024/project-group-lively-lions.git`) into your preferred folder
3. `cd project-group-lively-lions` then run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm run dev` to start a local development server on your machine.
5. Open your browser and navigate to local host to see the game in action.

### Other commands

- Alt + Shift + F should format the code in the current file according to Prettier + ESLint rules, otherwise you can also run `pnpm run format` to format all files.
- Running `pnpm run build` produces an application bundle that is suitable to be served over a static hosting service in `./dist`. Subsequently, running `pnpm run preview` will boot up a local server with the application bundle in `./dist`.
