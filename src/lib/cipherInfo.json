It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution, which means it uses multiple substitution alphabets to encrypt the text.\nGiven a keyword of 'key' and a phrase of 'hello', the phrase is encoded by shifting each character in the phrase by a number of positions equal to the corresponding character in the keyword. For example, 'h' in 'hello' is shifted by 'k' in 'key', 'e' by 'e', 'l' by 'y', and so on. When the keyword is shorter than the phrase, the keyword is repeated.",
