A fresh kill was left atop the altar, surrounded by carved bones, fur, and other offerings.

He looks back at the altar, and with horror he realises that the fresh kill on the altar is the corpse of a very mangled cat. This was much more dangerous than Purrlock expected, or had ever encountered before! A particularly large ginger cat stepped forward, his coat washed in some strange, sticky liquid.

Purrlock realised the pawlice must have had an anonymouse tip. \nPurrlock was arrested for smuggling illegal catnip. Caperton knew that, despite Purrlock’s history of catnip abuse, that Purrlock would not do such a thing, and sent another detective to gather evidence for Purrlock.

Purrlock’s fur prickled; a mighty storm was approaching. As he stepped out of his car, Purrlock drew his flashlight. He jumped over the crumbling brick outer walls and into the front yard. Weeds ran wild, almost completely obscuring the footpath. He looked up. The door was slightly ajar, as if taunting him to enter. Purrlock found his curious feet walk up the stairs, across the porch, and finally enter the building.\nThe interior, still proud despite its wear, was surprisingly well kept. Something, or someone, had been preventing ramsackers from ruining this place. The mysterious master, no doubt. As he explored each room, Purrlock found that the rest of the house was also tidy, with the exception of crazed symbols decorating the walls. Each room seemed to have a different cipher. \nAfter checking the ground floor and upstairs, Purrlock approached the basement. Purrlock, an avid reader and puzzle solver, was well aware that the basement would be where the climax of this case would occur. Surely the master could not resist a good clique, after all.

Everybody that he thought he made friends with abandoned him eventually, left him behind, leaving him alone. People used him. Hurt him. He vowed to find one as clever as him.

But first, Purrlock brought Keith to couples therapy, and the two bonded. They become besties. Purrlock made sure that Keith went to a prison focused on rehabilitation, and often made visits to check up on him.
